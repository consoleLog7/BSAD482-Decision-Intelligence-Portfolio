# Understanding Canada's Housing Crisis: Drivers of Supply, Demand, and Price
*A Decision Intelligence Analysis of SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities*

By: Logan Pugsley


## Problem Context
Canada is currently experiencing a serious nationwide housing crisis. Many Canadian residents from coast-to-coast are struggling to find places to live, and to afford the few places that are available to live in. Most Canadians can feel the pressure that comes with rising prices (whether they are home owners or housing renters), growing demand, and an inadequate supply in the housing market. This sentiment is outlined in countless reports that show since April of 2020, the onset of the global Covid-19 pandemic, housing prices have risen by more than 30% on average across Canada [[1]](#1). Although the short-term consequences that come from housing pressures (such as quality-of-life and public health implications) are serious, the long-term consequences that could come from not solving this issue quickly could be even worse. In April 2024, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) reported that only 26% of Canadians had the financial means to own a single-detached home, given the interest rates and prices at the time [[2]](#2). RBC also estimated that by 2030, more than half of the 1.9 million new households in Canada will not be able to buy a home, furthermore, 40% of that half of households also won't be able to afford rent at the projected market price [[3]](#3).

The housing crisis stems from several converging factors, for example, supply chain challenges for building materials, a rapidly growing Canadian population, rising income inequality, trends toward living in major cities, higher-than-usual interest rates, and regulatory barriers that discourage housing development. This decision intelligence analysis of this complex issue aims to explore the data behind these many factors, to uncover which indicators are most contributing to Canada's rising housing costs, and to understand how the convergance of various indicators has created the current housing crisis Canada faces.


## Significance of the Study
This decision intelligence analysis is both timely and crucial for several reasons:

1. __Affordability Crisis__ The average price of housing in Canada has risen by over 30% since 2020, and residents across the country struggle to afford somewhere to live [[1]](#1). Although the problem is concerning both urban and rural areas, with housing costs rising everywhere from Toronto, Ontario to Antigonish, Nova Scotia, the problem is worsened in major cities, where prices continue to rise even higher [[2]](#2). 

2. __Social and Health Implications__ Housing is a key social determinant of health that impacts risk for conditions including asthma, respiratory infections, poor mental health, and stress [[3]](#3).

3. __Long-Term Impacts__ Housing insecurity makes existing socio-economic problems even worse, by exacerbating homelessness, mental health issues, and inequality, particularly among marginalized groups such as low-income families, minority populations, and Indigenous communities [[4]](#4).

4. __Economic Ripple Effects__ The housing market and its current instability has far reaching impacts for Canada's overall economy, and economic recovery coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic [[5]](5). Housing diminishes consumer spending and can contribute to rising household debt, which can be drivers for a lagging gross domestic product (GDP) in Canada, its key economic measure [[5]](#5).


## Research Objectives
This study aims to:

1. Analyze key indicators that can impact supply, demand, and pricing for housing in Canada.

2. Analyze the relationship between key housing indicators, including immigration and urbanization statistics.

3. Identify the key determinants of Canada's housing crisis.

4. Project future improvement or worsening of Canada's housing crisis, using key indicators, relationships, and determinants identified in the analysis.
