- [X] Read milestone 2
- [X] Touch up the markdown, etc.
- [X] Download the data, and put it in the "data" directory.
- [X] Start putting code in a code directory (e.g. "src" directory is commonly used). Whatever visualizations we create, the code should go here.
- [X] On paper, draw a storyboard of what you hope to visualize.  You may have to play around with the data to see the notable trends, but start with a pencil and paper.  This helps highlight the data you will need to curate to get the target dataset.
