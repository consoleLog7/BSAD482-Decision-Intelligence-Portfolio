# Understanding Canada's Housing Crisis: Drivers of Supply, Demand, and Price

*A Decision Intelligence Analysis of SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities*

By: Logan Pugsley

## Executive Summary

This project examines Canada's housing crisis from the perspective of UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). Using open data that contains relevant data for various housing indicators and inputs, we aim to identify the key factors driving housing affordability, supply, and demand. Our analysis will use various data analytics, data visualization, and decision intelligence techniques to uncover insights about housing market trends, affordability gaps, and potential policy interventions.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. New Housing Price Index
   - Value: The New Housing Price Index provides a clear measure of how much the contractors who build new residential homes are selling their buildings for. It helps to identify impacts from construction materials and the total costs to build a home.
   - Indicates contractors' selling prices of new residential homes
   - Monthly series that measures changes over time
   - Detailed specifications pertaining to each house remain the same between two consecutive periods of measurement
   - Technical Details
      - Frequency: Monthly
      - Range: January 1981 - Present

2. Housing Affordability Index (HAI)
   - Value: The Housing Affordability Index (HAI) provides a clear measure of how affordable housing is relative to income levels. It helps identify whether housing costs are sustainable for the average household.
   - Measures the share of disposable income that a median-income household puts toward housing-related expenses
   - Ratio of housing-related costs (mortgage payments and utility fees) to average household disposable income
   - The higher the ratio, the more difficult it is to afford a home
   - Technical Details
      - Frequency: Quarterly
      - Range: 1983 Q3 - Present

3. Percentage Change in Construction Materials Cost
   - Value: The percentage change for the cost of construction materials provides a measure to indicate if prices for raw materials used in housing construction are rising or falling. It helps to identify if construction costs are contributing to higher or lower housing prices.
   - Construction costs are a key determinant for the supply of housing
   - The higher the percentage change from year-to-year, the higher the price of construction materials in that year
   - Technical Details
      - Frequency: Annually
      - Range: 2011 - Present

4. Yearly Population Growth
   - Value: The yearly population growth measures how much Canada's population grows each year. It helps to identify if there are more or less people in the housing market in Canada.
   - Population growth is a key determinant for the demand of housing
   - The higher the population growth, the higher the anticipated demand for housing should be
   - Technical Details
      - Frequency: Annually
      - Range: 1945 - Present

5. Total Housing Investment
   - Value: The total housing investment measures how much capital is being allocated and spent to grow and update Canada's housing market. It can be a lagging indicator to measure how the supply for housing could increase in future periods.
   - Housing investment is another key determinant for the supply of housing
   - The higher the total housing investment, the more new housing and converted housing developments should be available on the market
   - Technical Details
      - Frequency: Annually
      - Range: 2017 - Present
