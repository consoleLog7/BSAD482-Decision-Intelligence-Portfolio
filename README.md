# Understanding Canada's Housing Crisis: Drivers of Supply, Demand, and Price

*A Decision Intelligence Analysis of SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities*

By: Logan Pugsley

## Executive Summary

This project examines Canada's housing crisis from the perspective of UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). By analyzing open-source datasets <mark>freely available data is typically called "open data", not "open-source datasets"</mark> that contain relevant data for various housing indicators and inputs, we aim to identify the key factors driving housing affordability, supply, and demand. Our analysis will use advanced <mark>subjective</mark> analytics and decision intelligence techniques to uncover insights about housing market trends, affordability gaps, and potential policy interventions.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. Housing Affordability Index (HAI)

   <mark>consider adding a value statement here to show that you see the big picture, for example:  The index provides a clear measure of how affordable housing is relative to income levels. It helps identify whether housing costs are sustainable for the average household.</mark>

   - Measures the share of disposable income that a median-income household puts toward housing-related expenses
   - Ratio of housing-related costs (mortgage payments and utility fees) to average household disposable income
   - The higher the ratio, the more difficult it is to afford a home
  
   **Technical details:**
   
   * Frequency: Annual
   * Range: 1-100?
  
<mark>consider making similar changes for those that follow</mark>


2. **Rental Affordability Index (RAI)**

   - Measures the share of disposable income that a median-income household puts toward rent
   - Ratio of rent to average household disposable income
   - Target: Keeping below 30% threshold is generally reccommended by financial planners
3. **New Housing Price Index**

   - Indicates contractors' selling prices of new residential homes
   - Monthly series that measures changes over time
   - Detailed specifications pertaining to each house remain the same between two consecutive periods of measurement
4. **Vacancy Rate**

   - Vacant space available across Canada divided by inventory
   - Broken out into categories including apartments, offices, or industrial market inventory
   - Where vacant space is the sum of available, apartment, office or industrial market space
   - Vacant space excludes retail and below grade space
5. **Homelessness Rate**

   - Number of homeless people per 10,000 of population
   - This includes people who are living in shelters, or unhoused in public spaces or encampments
