# Understanding Canada's Housing Crisis: Drivers of Supply, Demand, and Price

*A Decision Intelligence Analysis of SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities*

By: Logan Pugsley

## Executive Summary

This project examines Canada's housing crisis from the perspective of UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). Using open data that contains relevant data for various housing indicators and inputs, we aim to identify the key factors driving housing affordability, supply, and demand. Our analysis will use various data analytics, data visualization, and decision intelligence techniques to uncover insights about housing market trends, affordability gaps, and potential policy interventions.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. Housing Affordability Index (HAI)
   - Value: The Housing Affordability Index (HAI) provides a clear measure of how affordable housing is relative to income levels. It helps identify whether housing costs are sustainable for the average household.
   - Measures the share of disposable income that a median-income household puts toward housing-related expenses
   - Ratio of housing-related costs (mortgage payments and utility fees) to average household disposable income
   - The higher the ratio, the more difficult it is to afford a home
   - Technical Details
      - Frequency: Quarterly
      - Range: 1983 Q3 - Present

2. Rental Affordability Index (RAI)
   - Value: The Rental Affordability Index (RAI) provides a clear measure of how affordable housing rent is relative to income levels. It helps identify whether housing rental costs are sustainable for the average household.
   - Measures the share of disposable income that a median-income household puts toward rent
   - Ratio of rent to average household disposable income
   - Target: Keeping below 30% threshold is generally reccommended by financial planners
   - Technical Details
      - Frequency: Quarterly
      - Range: 1983 Q3 - Present


3. New Housing Price Index
   - Value: The New Housing Price Index provides a clear measure of how much the contractors who build new residential homes are selling their buildings for. It helps to identify impacts from construction materials and the total costs to build a home.
   - Indicates contractors' selling prices of new residential homes
   - Monthly series that measures changes over time
   - Detailed specifications pertaining to each house remain the same between two consecutive periods of measurement
   - Technical Details
      - Frequency: Monthly
      - Range: January 1981 - Present

4. Vacancy Rate
   - Value: The Vacancy Rate provides a clear measure of how many apartments, offices, and homes are empty in Canada. In comparison with the HAI and RAI, it indicates if there are spaces available and identified if there is a demand or supply issue in the housing market.
   - Vacant space available across Canada divided by inventory
   - Broken out into categories including apartments, offices, or industrial market inventory
   - Where vacant space is the sum of available, apartment, office or industrial market space
   - Vacant space excludes retail and below grade space
   - Technical Details
      - Frequency: Annualy
      - Range: 1990 - Present

5. Homelessness Rate
   - Value: The Homelessness Rate provides a clear measure of how many Canadians are experiencing homelessness. It indicates how many people are truly unable to afford housing, compared with the HAI and RAI which focus more on individual income and their ability to afford housing.
   - Number of homeless people per 10,000 of population
   - This includes people who are living in shelters, or unhoused in public spaces or encampments
   - Technical Details
      - Frequency: Varies
      - Range: 2010 - Present
