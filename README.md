# Understanding Canada's Housing Crisis: Drivers of Supply, Demand, and Price

*A Decision Intelligence Analysis of SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities*

## Executive Summary

This project examines Canada's housing crisis from the perspective of UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). By analyzing open-source datasets that contain relevant data for various housing indicators and inputs, we aim to identify the key factors driving housing affordability, supply, and demand. Our analysis will use advanced analytics and decision intelligence techniques to uncover insights about housing market trends, affordability gaps, and potential policy interventions.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Housing Affordability Index (HAI)**

   - Measures the share of disposable income that a median-income household puts toward housing-related expenses
   - Ratio of housing-related costs (mortgage payments and utility fees) to average household disposable income
   - The higher the ratio, the more difficult it is to afford a home
2. **Rental Affordability Index (RAI)**

   - Measures the share of disposable income that a median-income household puts toward rent
   - Ratio of rent to average household disposable income
   - Target: Keeping below 30% threshold is generally reccommended by financial planners
3. **New Housing Price Index**

   - Indicates contractors' selling prices of new residential homes
   - Monthly series that measures changes over time
   - Detailed specifications pertaining to each house remain the same between two consecutive periods of measurement
4. **Vacancy Rate**

   - Vacant space available across Canada divided by inventory
   - Broken out into categories including apartments, offices, or industrial market inventory
   - Where vacant space is the sum of available, apartment, office or industrial market space
   - Vacant space excludes retail and below grade space
5. **Homelessness Rate**

   - Number of homeless people per 10,000 of population
   - This includes people who are living in shelters, or unhoused in public spaces or encampments
