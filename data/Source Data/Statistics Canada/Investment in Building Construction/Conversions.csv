Footnotes:
1,"For historical data see table 34-10-0175-01."
2,"Subtotals and totals may not exactly equal the sum of component parts due to system rounding."
3,"Monthly estimates for constant dollars are calculated using quarterly deflators from the Building Construction Price Index (18-10-0276-01). The monthly indexes used for the deflation process were part of a methodology review to increase the quality of the constant dollar and seasonally adjusted series. They previously displayed a step pattern due to lower frequency collection."
4,"Data for the census metropolitan areas (CMA) of Fredericton, Drummondville, Red Deer, Nanaimo, Kamloops and Chilliwack for the period of 2017 to 2020 is for reference only. These six CMAs were officially created only in 2021. Estimates for the period of 2017 to 2020 are obtained by rolling-up data from current Census Sub-Divisions (CSD) underneath each of them."
