1,"The Building permits survey covers all Canadian municipalities that issue permits. The number of Canadian municipalities currently surveyed is approximately 2,400, representing all the provinces and territories. They account for 95% of the Canadian population. Historically, the data are not strictly comparable due to the continuing improvement in coverage and the modifications to the geographical areas required to reflect the most recent census definitions."
2,"For historical data see table 34100066."
3,"Data processing methodology has been updated as of January 2018. Comparisons between the previous data and the subsequent data should be used with caution."
4,"The sum may not add up to the total due to rounding."
5,"Data for the provincial totals can not be reconciled because data at the census agglomerations and census subdivision levels is not publish in this table."
6,"Detailed information for all types of work may not be available for all regions, as permit regulations and requirements vary by municipality."
